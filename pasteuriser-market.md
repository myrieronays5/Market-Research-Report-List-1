<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pasteuriser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plate Heat Exchangers</li><li>Shell or Tube Heat Exchangers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pasteuriser market is primarily segmented into two types of heat exchangers: plate heat exchangers and shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Plate heat exchangers utilize thin, corrugated plates to provide a large surface area for efficient heat transfer, making them compact and easy to clean. In contrast, shell-and-tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes enclosed within a shell, allowing for robust heat exchange and accommodating larger volumes. Both types play crucial roles in the food and beverage industry for safe pasteurization.</p></p>
