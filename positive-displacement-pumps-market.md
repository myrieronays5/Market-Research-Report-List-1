<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Displacement Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reciprocating Pumps</li><li>Rotary Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The positive displacement pumps market is categorized into two main types: reciprocating pumps and rotary pumps. Reciprocating pumps use a back-and-forth motion to move fluids, making them ideal for high-pressure applications and precise flow control. In contrast, rotary pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and displacing it through rotational movement, offering smooth and continuous flow, suitable for low to medium viscosity fluids. Both types are essential in various industries, including oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and water treatment.</p></p>
